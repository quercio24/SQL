-- SELF-SUCCIFIENCY EXAM 
-- 1) 
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'naep';
-- 2) FIRST 50 records..
SELECT *
FROM naep
LIMIT 50 ; 
-- 3) Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. 
-- Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.
SELECT round(avg(avg_math_4_score)), max(avg_math_4_score), min(avg_math_4_score), count(*), state
FROM naep
GROUP by state  
ORDER by state 
-- 4) Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only the
-- summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences in max and min 
-- values that are greater than 30.
WITH sum_table as (
SELECT round(avg(avg_math_4_score)), max(avg_math_4_score), min(avg_math_4_score), count(*), state
FROM naep
GROUP by state  
ORDER by state )
SELECT *
FROM sum_table
WHERE (max - min) > 30 
-- 5) Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states that lists the states 
-- in the bottom 10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.
SELECT state as bottom_10_states
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000'
ORDER by avg_math_4_score
LIMIT 10 ; 
-- 6) Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score rounded to 
-- the nearest 2 decimal places over all states in the year 2000.
SELECT round(avg(avg_math_4_score),2) as avg_of_avg_math_4
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000'
-- 7) Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000 that 
-- lists all states with an avg_math_4_score less than the average over all states 
-- in the year 2000. 
SELECT state as below_average_states_y2000
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000' and avg_math_4_score < ALL (
SELECT round(avg(avg_math_4_score),2)
	FROM naep
	WHERE year = '2000'
)
-- 8) Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that lists any 
-- states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score column of the naep data table for 
-- the year 2000. 
SELECT avg_math_4_score as scores_missing_y2000, state 
FROM naep 
WHERE year = '2000' and avg_math_4_score is NULL 
-- 9) Write a query that returns for the year 2000 the state, 
-- avg_math_4_score, and total_expenditure from the naep table left outer 
-- joined with the finance table, using id as the key and ordered by total_expenditure 
-- greatest to least. Be sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest 2 decimal places,
-- and then filter out NULL avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.
SELECT naep.year, naep.state, round(avg_math_4_score,2) as avg_score, total_expenditure
FROM naep 
LEFT OUTER JOIN finance
ON naep.id = finance.id
WHERE naep.year = '2000' and avg_math_4_score is Not NULL 
ORDER by total_expenditure DESC;
